This project is part of **Hacktoberfest 2024** and aims to collect **Hello World** programs written in as many different programming languages as possible. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, contributing to this repo is super easy ‚Äî just write a simple Hello World program!

## üìã Project Overview

### Current Structure:

- `contributions/cpp/hello-world.cpp`
- `contributions/dart/hello-world.dart`
- `contributions/go/hello-world.go`
- `contributions/java/HelloWorld.java`
- `contributions/javascript/hello_world.js`
- `contributions/php/hello-world.php`
- `contributions/python/hello_world.py`

   `python
print("Hello, World!")
`
   Make sure the file follows the naming convention: `hello_world.<extension>`, and is placed inside the respective language folder.

### 5. Commit Your Changes
